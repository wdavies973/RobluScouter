/**
 * A model that stores data that will be transferred to the Roblu Cloud server, a hosted server, Bluetooth, or QR codes.
 *
 * This is the 3rd hand-off model iteration, successor to RCheckout and RAssignment
 *
 * More on hand-off:
 * RCheckout is a packaging utility for Roblu. Any time data goes to the server, all data to be transported will be
 * set into the RCheckout class and serialized as a string. However, the ID number should be sent to the server
 * as a SEPARATE PARAMETER, and NOT IN THE SERIALIZED CONTENT
 *
 * Important steps:
 * 1) To flag this handoff as ready for upload, save the handoff to directory /pending/, this will notify the background service that
 * we're ready to upload. After a successful upload attempt, the service will delete the handoff from /pending/. Note: flagging for upload
 * should save twice, once to /checkouts/ and once to /pending/.
 *
 * RCheckout's will still be referred to as checkouts in many places, but they needed a different name for technical implementations.
 * Generally speaking, checkouts refer to the UI implementation, and handoffs refer to the backend.
 *

 * @since 3.5.9
